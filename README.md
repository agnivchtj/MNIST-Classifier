# MNIST Classifier

The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits. Each row in the dataset is a 28x28 grayscale image. 
Each feature x_i,j represents the pixel value in the ith row and jth column. 
There is also a down-sampled versions of this dataset. In this down-sampled version, all the images are 8x8 grayscale images. 
Except for the downsampling, both datasets are exactly the same and have the exact same order. This is seen when plotting images of both datasets.
